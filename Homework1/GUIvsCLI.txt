Both GUI and CLI are ways to interact with your computer. However, both of them function in different ways. GUI, which stands for Graphical User Interface, is visual based.

Examples of GUI includes folders, buttons, and cursors. CLI, which stands for Command Line Interface, is text based. Examples of CLI includes changing file names and adding

files. GUI is more user friendly than CLI. Even my mom (who is not tech savvy at all) can mostly manage navigating a computer using GUI (sorry, mom). CLI is a lot more precise

and faster to use once you've gotten the hang of it.
