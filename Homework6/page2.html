        <h1>Short Story</h1>
        <h3>Magdalena awoke with an ache in her stomach. She’s still in her coffin, but can sense that it's barely nightfall. How is she starving already? Tossing and turning relentlessly– it finally clicks. She hasn't fed in a few nights. Magdelena desperately needs the blood, but it's been hard to find the motivation. She has no one, just walking through eternal life, completely alone. The same routine– eat, sleep, eat, sleep, over and over. Annoyed, Magdelena tries to put these thoughts to rest. Pushing off the lid of her coffin, she decides to give in to life’s monotonous cycles and find a meal.<p></p> She walks for what feels like hours; not a single soul in sight. As her hope wears down, the thoughts begin to loop in her mind again. Then, as if a God heard her prayers, she begins to hear the drum of a steady beat. A heart beat to be exact. And about two blocks to her… left, she believes. Barely able to contain her giddy excitement, she almost starts skipping down the street when suddenly she begins to pick up on the scent. A scent so sweet that it calls to her. The vampire– a creature known for hypnotizing its victims, was being hypnotized for the first time in 200 years. If this was her last meal she would be at peace. As Magdelena rounds the corner, she sees the most beautiful woman she has ever laid eyes on.</h3>
